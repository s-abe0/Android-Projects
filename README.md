# Android-Projects
Picking up android programming as a hobby/personal interest. Some of these projects will be from the book Android Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 3rd Edition (excellent book so far) with some of the end of chapter challenges completed and maybe some other modifications here and there.
