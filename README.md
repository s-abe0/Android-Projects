# Android-Projects
Picking up android programming as a hobby/personal interest. Some of these projects will be from the book Android Programming The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 3rd Edition (excellent book so far) with some of the end of chapter challenges completed and maybe some other modifications here and there. 

** GeoQuiz **
The first project from the Android Programming book. GeoQuiz is created during the first six chapters, but I only have written the code up to and including chapter five,
and have completed various end of chapter challenges. Chapter six is about Android SDK versions and compatibility, and the code in that chapter was not super important to include.

** CompSciQuiz **
A side project of mine after finishing GeoQuiz. It is a very basic True/False quiz with various questions about computer programming topics, such as Interfaces, Abstraction, Generics,
Inheritance, etc. I am mostly using it for myself to keep my mind fresh with computer science topics while job hunting. It is still in development; it needs more questions.  

** CriminalIntent **
Second project from the Android Programming book. Starts in chapter 7.
